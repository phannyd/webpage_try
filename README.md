# Personal Webpage

This is a minimal static personal website scaffold (HTML/CSS/JS) intended for hosting on GitHub Pages.

Quick start

- Preview locally (from repository root):

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

- Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (or use an existing one).
2. Push this folder to the repository's `main` branch.
3. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages, selecting the `main` branch and the root folder.

Files

- `index.html` — landing page
- `research.html` — research overview
- `publications.html` — publications list
- `teaching.html` — teaching and materials
- `contact.html` — contact and form
- `assets/` — CSS and JS assets

Next steps

- Replace placeholder text and sample publications with your real content.
- Add PDFs, BibTeX entries, and links to code repositories.
- Optionally add a `CNAME` file for a custom domain.
